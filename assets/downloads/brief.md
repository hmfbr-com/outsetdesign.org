## 1. What is Outset Design?

**Outset Design** is a framework concerned with the design, analysis, and improvement of beginnings — the points at which assumptions are formed, commitments are made, structures are set, and paths become constrained.

An **outset** is any moment or condition where:

- options narrow,
    
- consequences begin to compound,
    
- and later correction becomes meaningfully more costly or impossible.
    

Outset Design focuses on these moments **before outcomes are locked in**.

---

## 2. Why beginnings matter disproportionately

Across human and world systems, failures are rarely caused by execution alone.  
They are more often caused by early decisions, defaults, or omissions that later become normalized, hidden, or irreversible.

Once such conditions are established:

- downstream optimization can mitigate harm,
    
- but rarely eliminate its root causes.
    

Outset Design addresses this leverage gap by shifting attention and responsibility **upstream**, where design choices still shape which futures remain possible.

## 3. What Outset Design is not

Outset Design is **not**:

- a replacement for domain expertise,
    
- a theory of everything,
    
- a method for controlling outcomes,
    
- or a post-hoc evaluation framework.
    

It does not prescribe specific results.  
It operates **before** implementation, where design choices determine the space of outcomes.

## 4. The object of study: outsets

Outset Design treats outsets themselves as a first-class object of study.  
A minimal set of analytical lenses includes:

- **Cognitive outsets**  
    Framing, assumptions, defaults, and what is considered “in scope”.
    
- **Normative outsets**  
    Principles, legitimacy, values, and red lines.
    
- **Commitment outsets**  
    Agreements, obligations, lock-ins, and points of no return.
    
- **Structural outsets**  
    Architectures, governance, incentives, roles, and control surfaces.
    
- **Temporal outsets**  
    Sequencing, timing, irreversibility, and compounding effects.
    

These outsets interact and stack in practice.  
Upstream outsets condition downstream ones.

## 5. The Outset Stack

Outsets typically stack in the following order:

1. Cognitive outset
    
2. Normative outset
    
3. Commitment outset
    
4. Structural outset
    
5. Temporal outset
    

The earlier an issue is addressed in this stack, the higher the available leverage and the lower the cost of correction.

This is why Outset Design prioritizes **early clarity** over late optimization.

## 6. Applying Outset Design in practice

Outset Design is applied using a minimal practice format called the  
**Outset Analysis Case (OAC)**.

An OAC is a concise, structured analysis of a situation at the point where outcomes are still being shaped. Its purpose is to surface assumptions, commitments, structures, and timing **before** they become locked in.

The canonical OAC format includes:

1. Context
    
2. Cognitive outset
    
3. Normative outset
    
4. Commitment outset
    
5. Structural outset
    
6. Temporal outset
    
7. No-go conditions
    
8. Review horizon
    

The OAC is designed to remain lightweight and domain-agnostic.

## 7. Relationship to Fair Deal Policy (FDP)

The **Fair Deal Policy (FDP)** is a canonical application of Outset Design focused on fairness, power asymmetry, and pre-commitment.

Outset Design is the general framework.  
FDP is a reference-grade instance within that framework.

Where fairness and power asymmetry are central concerns, Outset Design naturally intersects with FDP.

## 8. Alignment and evolution

Outset Design distinguishes between:

- **Canonical elements**, which change slowly
    
- **Applications**, which may evolve freely
    

Canonical elements include:

- the definition of an outset,
    
- the Outset Stack,
    
- the Outset Analysis Case structure,
    
- and explicit scope limits.
    

Applications may adapt, fork, or extend the framework, provided that changes to canonical elements are clearly disclosed and attributed.

---

## 9. Status

Outset Design is an **emerging framework**.

Its evolution is expected to be:

- slower than its applications,
    
- driven by demonstrated necessity,
    
- and guided by structural clarity rather than expansion.
    

---

## Closing note

Outset Design does not seek to manage outcomes.

It asks a simpler and more demanding question:

**At the moment where it still matters most,  
are we willing to design the beginning responsibly?**
