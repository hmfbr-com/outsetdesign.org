# Outset Analysis Case
## A minimal format for applying Outset Design

An **Outset Analysis Case (OAC)** is a concise, structured analysis of a situation at the point where outcomes are still being shaped.

Its purpose is to surface assumptions, commitments, structures, and timing **before** they become locked in.

The OAC is designed to be lightweight, reusable, and domain-agnostic.

## When to use an Outset Analysis Case

Use an OAC when:
- entering a collaboration or agreement,
- designing a system or policy,
- initiating a project with long-term consequences,
- or when downstream correction would be costly.

## The canonical format (v1.0)

### 1. Context
What situation, decision, or system is being initiated?

---

### 2. Cognitive outset
How is the situation currently framed?
What assumptions or defaults are implicit?

---

### 3. Normative outset
What principles, values, or legitimacy constraints apply?
What would be unacceptable?

---

### 4. Commitment outset
What commitments, obligations, or lock-ins would begin?
Who becomes bound, and how?

---

### 5. Structural outset
What structures, roles, incentives, or control surfaces are set?
Where does power concentrate?

---

### 6. Temporal outset
What sequencing or timing creates irreversibility or compounding effects?

---

### 7. No-go conditions
Under what conditions should this not proceed?

---

### 8. Review horizon
When and how should this outset be revisited?

## Relationship to FDP

When fairness, power asymmetry, or pre-commitment are central concerns, the Outset Analysis Case seeps naturally into the domain of the **Fair Deal Policy (FDP)**.

In such cases, FDP can be used to deepen the normative and commitment sections of the analysis.
